# Image-Measure
Check the program out in the releases menu! This is only a pre-release for now but I expect to work on it more and refine it.

I have gotten a lot of projects recently where I am given a photo and an overall dimension and expected to make a part. I have been looking for a tool so that I could set a scale for the image and then get other measurements but I have not been able to find anything. This tool is my attempt to solve my problem.

As you can see in this picture, I have two images pulled up of a motorcycle brake pedal that I would like to get some measurements off of. Using this program, I was able to get enough measurements to make a new brake pedal.

How to use:

- The first step when you open the program is to import a photo. You can do this through the top dropdown menu.

- After you open the image, click on two points on the image that you know the distance between. For example, on the demo image I selected two edges of an inch on the ruler.

- This will then bring up a pop-up for you to enter the known distance. On the demo image, I inputted "1" because I selected the edges of an inch on the ruler. 

- Now you can make lines by clicking on points to make lines on the image. These lines will be labeled with approximately how long they are based on the original line that we made.

That's it! You should be able to use this program to estimate dimensions based off an image.
